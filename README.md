# SaltProductionMonitor

This project is an Arduino Uno-based measurement system for monitoring salt production processes. It measures and records real-time data on outdoor wind speed, temperature, humidity, brine pool water temperature, and conductivity, storing the information on an SD card.

## Features

- Real-time measurement and recording of:
  - Outdoor wind speed
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Brine pool water temperature
  - Conductivity
- Data storage on SD card for later analysis
- Monitoring key parameters of the salt production process

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- Wind speed sensor
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Water temperature sensor
- Conductivity sensor
- SD card module
